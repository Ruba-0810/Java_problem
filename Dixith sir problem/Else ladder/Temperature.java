/*Suppose you have a temperature sensor 
in a room, and you want to determine 
if the current temperature reading falls within 
an acceptable range for the room's comfort.
You have predefined lower and upper bounds for 
the acceptable temperature range (e.g., lower bound 70°F and upper bound = 80°F).
You write a program to read the current temperature value in Celsius 
(in this case, 25°C) and convert it into Fahrenheit, print the temperature in 
Fahrenheit, 
then check if it falls within the specified range. If it does, 
the program prints
 "Temperature is within the range".

Test Case 1:
Input: 23
Output: 73.4

Temperature is within the range
