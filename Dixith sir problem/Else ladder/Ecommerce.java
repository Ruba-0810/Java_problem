/*
For an Ecommerce application we need to write a logic to calculate the total price of the purchase 
after applying the discount. The discount are as follows,If the customer is a teenager, 
flat discount 5%. If the total purchase price is above 5000 after the flat discount 
customer gets additional 5% discount.
If the customer is in 20's flat discount 6%. If the total
purchase price is above 4000 after the flat discount
customer gets additional 6% discount.If the customer is aged above 29 flat discount 15%.
Assume the age and total purchase price is given as input.
Write a program to calculate the total price of purchase after discount and display, 
total price before discount, total price after discount, discounted amount if any.
Test Case 1:

Input age:12
Input total price:200
Output:200
200
Test Case 2:
Input age: 19
Input total price: 2000
Output:2000
1900
100
Test Case 3:
Input age:21
Input total price:10000
Output:10000
